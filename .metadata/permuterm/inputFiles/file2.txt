Death Adder(Poisonous)

You know that famous legend about Cleopatra using a snake to kill herself?
The type of snake she supposedly used was a death adder. 
You can find these snakes throughout Australia, New Guinea, and other regions.
A bite can result in paralysis, respiratory arrest, and death inside of only six hours.
With fast treatment, a patient is unlikely to die, but without treatment, about 50% of bites are lethal.
Death adders also prey on other snakes and small mammals.
The common death adder has a broad flattened, triangular head and a thick body with bands of red, brown and black with a grey, cream or pink belly. 
It can reach a maximum body length of 70–100 centimetres (2.3–3.3 ft). Death adders possess the longest fangs of any Australian snake.
It doesn't lay eggs Unlike the common or European adder (Vipera berus), the common death adder is a member of the snake family Elapidae, rather than the family Viperidae, which are not found in Australia.
